        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "1. Mutable objects in Python can be changed after they are created. When you modify a mutable object, such as adding an element to a list or changing a value in a dictionary, the changes are made directly to the original object. This means the object’s memory reference remains the same even after modification. Common examples of mutable objects include lists, dictionaries, and sets. For instance, using my_list.append(4) will update the existing list without creating a new one.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Immutable objects, on the other hand, cannot be changed once they are created. If you try to modify them, Python creates a new object in memory instead of altering the original. This ensures that the original data remains unchanged. Examples of immutable objects include integers, strings, floats, tuples, and booleans. For example, when you perform \"Hello\" + \" World\", a new string is created rather than modifying the original \"Hello\"."

        "Ans:  **Different Types of Operators in Python with Examples**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides various types of operators that help perform operations on variables and values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Arithmetic Operators**\n",
        "These are used to perform mathematical operations. For example, `+` is used for addition (`10 + 5` gives `15`), `-` for subtraction (`10 - 3` gives `7`), `*` for multiplication (`4 * 2` gives `8`), and `/` for division (`10 / 2` gives `5.0`). Other operators include `%` for modulus (`10 % 3` gives `1`), `**` for exponentiation (`2 ** 3` gives `8`), and `//` for floor division (`10 // 3` gives `3`).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Comparison (Relational) Operators**\n",
        "These operators compare values and return `True` or `False`. For example, `==` checks if two values are equal (`5 == 5` is `True`), `!=` checks if they are not equal, `>` checks if one is greater than another, `<` for less than, and `>=` or `<=` for greater than or equal to / less than or equal to.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Logical Operators**\n",
        "Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions. The `and` operator returns `True` only if both conditions are true (e.g., `5 > 2 and 3 < 4`), `or` returns `True` if at least one condition is true, and `not` reverses the result (`not True` becomes `False`).\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Assignment Operators**\n",
        "These operators are used to assign values to variables. The basic one is `=`, as in `x = 10`. Compound assignment operators like `+=` (e.g., `x += 5`) increase the value of `x` by 5, while `-=` subtracts, and so on with `*=`, `/=`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Bitwise Operators**\n",
        "Bitwise operators operate on binary representations of integers. For example, `&` is bitwise AND (`5 & 3` gives `1`), `|` is OR, `^` is XOR, `~` is NOT, `<<` shifts bits to the left, and `>>` shifts them to the right.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Membership Operators**\n",
        "These check if a value exists in a sequence like a list, string, or tuple. For example, `2 in [1, 2, 3]` returns `True`, while `4 not in [1, 2, 3]` returns `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. Identity Operators**\n",
        "Identity operators check whether two variables refer to the same object in memory. `is` returns `True` if both variables point to the same object, and `is not` returns `True` if they do not. For example, `a is b` is `True` if both `a` and `b` refer to the same object.\n"
