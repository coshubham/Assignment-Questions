Open source Operating system providing a command line interface (CLI) that allows user to interact with the system through text-based commands and  is similar to Unix it is built upon the Linux Kernel. The Linux Kernel is like the brain of the operating system because it manages how the computer interacts with its hardware and resources.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: A hard link is a reference that points directly to the inode (data structure) of a file on the disk. It creates another filename for the same data, and both the original file and the hard link are treated equally by the filesystem.\n",
